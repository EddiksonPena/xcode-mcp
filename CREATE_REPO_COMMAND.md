# Create GitHub Repository - Exact Command for Cursor

## 🎯 Use This Exact Command in Cursor

Copy and paste this into Cursor:

```
Use the GitHub MCP to create a new repository with:
- Name: xcode-mcp
- Description: Comprehensive Model Context Protocol server for Xcode development automation. 118 tools for iOS/macOS development including build, test, simulator, crash reporting, asset management, localization, and AI-powered workflows.
- Visibility: public
- Don't initialize with README (we already have one)
```

Or the shorter version:

```
Create a GitHub repository named "xcode-mcp" with description "Xcode MCP Server - 118 tools for iOS/macOS development" and make it public
```

---

## 📋 Alternative: Step-by-Step

If the above doesn't work, try:

```
Use GitHub MCP create_repo tool with:
- repository name: xcode-mcp
- description: Comprehensive MCP server for Xcode development automation with 118 tools
- private: false
```

---

## ✅ After Repository is Created

Once the repository is created on GitHub, run:

```bash
cd /Users/eddiksonpena/Projects/xcode-mcp
./create_github_repo.sh
```

This will automatically:
1. Add the GitHub remote
2. Push your code
3. Set up the connection

**Just paste the command above into Cursor and it will create the repository via GitHub MCP!**
